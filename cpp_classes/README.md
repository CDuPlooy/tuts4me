# CPP - Working With Classes

A collection of my own personal notes on working with classes.
To run a particular example navigate to the directory and run make.


Classes allow us to create abstractions on top of more complex things.
A class can have it's own set of methods and it's own set of data.
The access specifier dictates how you interact with these two;

- A good rule of thumb is that when a data type is private you should not
be toying with it or using a mutator/accessor.
- However when something is public, you can do whatever you like.
